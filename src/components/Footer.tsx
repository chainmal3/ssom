              As we come together through rhythm, bass, and collective movement,
              we honor the rich history of gathering and storytelling that has
              taken place on these lands for over 60,000 years. We acknowledge
              that long before speakers resonated across these spaces, the
              vibrations of song, dance, and ceremony connected people to
              Country and to each other on this sacred ground.
